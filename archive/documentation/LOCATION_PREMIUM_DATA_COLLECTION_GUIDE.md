```

**File:** `LOCATION_PREMIUM_DATA_TEMPLATE.csv`

---

## üîÑ How I'll Process Your Data

Once you provide the data:

### Step 1: Validation
```python
- Check area name doesn't already exist
- Verify GPS coordinates are in Dubai (lat: 24.8-25.5, lon: 54.9-55.6)
- Ensure distances are reasonable (0-50 km range)
- Validate neighborhood score (1.0-5.0)
```

### Step 2: Insert into Database
```sql
INSERT INTO area_coordinates (
    area_name, latitude, longitude,
    distance_to_metro_km, distance_to_beach_km, 
    distance_to_mall_km, distance_to_school_km,
    distance_to_business_km, neighborhood_score,
    geocoded_source, geocoded_at
) VALUES (
    'Arabian Ranches', 25.0533, 55.2589,
    8.5, 25.3, 6.2, 10.0, 12.5, 4.5,
    'manual', NOW()
);
```

### Step 3: Clear Cache
```sql
DELETE FROM property_location_cache 
WHERE area_name = 'Arabian Ranches';
```

### Step 4: Verify
```sql
-- Calculate premium
SELECT 
    area_name,
    GREATEST(0, 15 - distance_to_metro_km * 3) as metro_premium,
    GREATEST(0, 30 - distance_to_beach_km * 6) as beach_premium,
    GREATEST(0, 8 - distance_to_mall_km * 2) as mall_premium,
    GREATEST(0, 10 - distance_to_business_km * 2) as business_premium,
    (neighborhood_score - 3.0) * 4 as neighborhood_premium,
    -- Total (capped at -20% to +50%)
    GREATEST(-20, LEAST(50,
        GREATEST(0, 15 - distance_to_metro_km * 3) +
        GREATEST(0, 30 - distance_to_beach_km * 6) +
        GREATEST(0, 8 - distance_to_mall_km * 2) +
        GREATEST(0, 10 - distance_to_business_km * 2) +
        (neighborhood_score - 3.0) * 4
    )) as total_premium_pct
FROM area_coordinates
WHERE area_name = 'Arabian Ranches';
```

- [ ] Distances are **positive numbers** (no negatives)
- [ ] Neighborhood scores between **1.0 and 5.0** (with decimals okay)
- [ ] No **empty cells** (use 10.0 for unknown distances)
- [ ] Area names **match** property listing names exactly

## üí° Tips for Fast Collection

### Use Google Maps Lists
1. Create a "Dubai Areas" list in Google Maps
2. Save each area location
3. Export to CSV with coordinates

### Use Existing Property Data
Check your property listings:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT area_en, COUNT(*) as properties
FROM properties
WHERE area_en NOT IN (
    SELECT area_name FROM area_coordinates
)
GROUP BY area_en
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

This gives you the **most important areas** by transaction volume.

### Batch Processing
Collect data in batches of 10-20 areas at a time.  
I can insert them quickly in bulk.

## ‚ùì FAQs

**Q: What if I don't know the exact distance?**  
A: Estimate! ¬±1 km accuracy is fine. Use Google Maps measure tool.

**Q: What if an area has no nearby metro?**  
A: Put the distance to the nearest metro anyway (even if 20+ km). The formula will give 0% premium automatically.

**Q: How do I decide the neighborhood score?**  
A: Think: "Would I recommend this area to a premium client?" Higher score = more desirable. When unsure, use 3.5.

**Q: Can I update data later?**  
A: Yes! We can always update distances and scores as we get better information.

**Q: What about school distance?**  
A: Optional for now. Leave empty or use 10.0 km as default. We'll refine later.

**Q: Do I need to collect ALL 239 areas?**  
A: No! Start with top 20-50 most searched areas. We'll expand gradually.
