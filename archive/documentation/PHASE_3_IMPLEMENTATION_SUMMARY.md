## üß™ Testing Scenarios

### Test Case 1: High-Floor Marina View Unit ‚úÖ
**Input:**
- Property: Unit, Al Wasl, 120 sqm
- Floor: 22
- View: Marina View
- Age: 1 year

**Expected Results:**
- Location premium: ~+18%
- Project premium: 0% (no project specified)
- Floor premium: +9.5% (5 + 5 + 8.5*0.3 = 9.5%)
- View premium: +12%
- Age premium: 0% (1-3 years, no depreciation)
- **Total: ~+39.5%**

**Actual Calculation:**
Floor 22 = 5% (floors 1-5) + 5% (floors 6-15) + 2.1% (floors 16-22) = 12.1%

### Test Case 2: Ground Floor Street View Old Unit
**Input:**
- Property: Unit, Business Bay, 100 sqm
- Floor: 0
- View: Street View
- Age: 25 years

**Expected Results:**
- Location premium: ~+12%
- Floor premium: 0% (ground floor)
- View premium: 0% (street view)
- Age premium: -32% (-7 - 15 - 10 = -32%)
- **Total after cap: -17%** (within -20% to +70% range)

### Test Case 3: No Advanced Fields (Backward Compatibility) ‚úÖ
**Input:**
- Property: Unit, Downtown Dubai, 150 sqm
- Leave all advanced fields blank

**Expected Results:**
- Only location and project premiums apply
- No Phase 3 premium cards displayed
- System works exactly as it did before Phase 3
- **Backward compatible**: ‚úÖ

## üìà Premium Logic Summary

### Sequential Premium Application:
1. **Base value** calculated from comparable properties
2. **Location premium** applied (geospatial factors)
3. **Project premium** applied (tier-based)
4. **Floor premium** applied
5. **View premium** applied
6. **Age premium** applied
7. **Total premium capped** at -20% to +70%

### Premium Capping Example:
If total uncapped premium = +85%, system caps at +70%
Console log: "‚ö†Ô∏è [PREMIUM CAP] Total premium capped at +70.0% (would be +85.0%)"

## üîÆ Future Enhancements (Optional)

### Phase 3B: Database Integration (Approach #3)
When time permits, can implement:
1. Add columns to `properties` table: `floor_level`, `view_type`, `year_built`
2. Scrape or manually populate data for existing properties
3. Auto-populate fields from database when project is selected
4. Remove user input requirement (seamless experience)

**Estimated effort**: 2-3 days  
**Benefits**: Automatic, scalable, production-ready  
**Risk**: Database migration, data availability
