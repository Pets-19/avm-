## 🐛 **Root Cause Analysis**

### **Problem**: ID Mismatch Between HTML and JavaScript

**HTML Elements** (what exists):
```html
<span id="modal-avg-price">--</span>      ← Line 709
<span id="modal-tier">--</span>            ← Line 715
```

**JavaScript Code** (what it tried to access):
```javascript
document.getElementById('modal-avg-price-sqm')   ← Wrong! ❌
document.getElementById('modal-tier-display')     ← Wrong! ❌
```

**Result**: JavaScript tried to set `textContent` on `null` (element doesn't exist) → TypeError

---

## ✅ **Fix Applied**

### **Changed** (Line ~2551-2552):

**BEFORE** ❌:
```javascript
document.getElementById('modal-avg-price-sqm').textContent = ...;
document.getElementById('modal-tier-display').textContent = ...;
```

**AFTER** ✅:
```javascript
document.getElementById('modal-avg-price').textContent = ... + ' AED/sqm';
document.getElementById('modal-tier').textContent = ...;
```

---

## ✅ **Bonus Fix: Rental Yield Visibility**

### **Issue**: 
Console showed `💰 Rental Yield: 3.60%` but card wasn't visible on page

### **Root Cause**:
Only setting `display: block` - might be overridden by CSS or other properties

### **Fix Applied**:
```javascript
// BEFORE ❌
document.getElementById('rental-yield-card').style.display = 'block';

// AFTER ✅
const rentalCard = document.getElementById('rental-yield-card');
rentalCard.style.display = 'block';
rentalCard.style.visibility = 'visible';  // Force visibility
rentalCard.style.opacity = '1';           // Force opacity
```

## 🐛 **If Issues Persist**

### **Modal Still Not Opening**:
1. Hard refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
2. Check console for NEW errors
3. Verify element exists in console:
   ```javascript
   document.getElementById('modal-avg-price')
   document.getElementById('modal-tier')
   ```
   Both should return `<span>` elements, not `null`

### **Rental Yield Still Not Visible**:
1. Check if element exists:
   ```javascript
   document.getElementById('rental-yield-card')
   ```
   Should return the card element
   
2. Check computed styles:
   ```javascript
   const card = document.getElementById('rental-yield-card');
   console.log(card.style.display);     // Should be 'block'
   console.log(card.style.visibility);  // Should be 'visible'
   console.log(card.style.opacity);     // Should be '1'
   ```

3. Check parent container:
   ```javascript
   const grid = document.querySelector('.valuation-details-grid');
   console.log(grid.style.display);     // Should show grid properties
   ```
