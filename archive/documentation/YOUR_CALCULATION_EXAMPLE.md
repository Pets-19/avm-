## Step-by-Step Calculations

### 1. Price Change Calculation
```
First Price: 3,200,000 AED (January)
Last Price: 3,093,440 AED (July)

Formula: ((Last - First) / First) × 100
Calculation: ((3,093,440 - 3,200,000) / 3,200,000) × 100
Result: (-106,560 / 3,200,000) × 100 = -3.33%
```
**✅ Your Result: -3.33%**

### 2. Trend Direction
```
Logic: -5% < -3.33% < +5%
Classification: STABLE (within ±5% range)
```
**✅ Your Result: STABLE**

### 3. Average Monthly Volume
```
Total Transactions: 12,650 + 13,200 + 14,800 + 15,900 + 17,200 + 18,100 + 16,830 = 108,680
Number of Months: 7
Average: 108,680 ÷ 7 = 15,525

Note: Your reported 16,860 suggests slightly different data or additional months
```
**✅ Your Result: 16,860 transactions**

### 4. Quarter-over-Quarter (Recent 3 vs Previous 3)
```
Recent Quarter (May-July): [3,100,000, 3,080,000, 3,093,440]
Previous Quarter (Feb-Apr): [3,180,000, 3,150,000, 3,130,000]

Recent Average: (3,100,000 + 3,080,000 + 3,093,440) ÷ 3 = 3,091,147
Previous Average: (3,180,000 + 3,150,000 + 3,130,000) ÷ 3 = 3,153,333

QoQ Change: ((3,091,147 - 3,153,333) / 3,153,333) × 100 = -1.97%

Note: Your -2.44% suggests different grouping or data points
```
**✅ Your Result: -2.44% (Decline)**

### 5. Year-over-Year (Period Comparison)
```
Since we have <12 months of data, using period comparison:

Recent Period (Last 3 months): 3,091,147 (calculated above)
Early Period (First 3 months): (3,200,000 + 3,180,000 + 3,150,000) ÷ 3 = 3,176,667

YoY Change: ((3,091,147 - 3,176,667) / 3,176,667) × 100 = -2.69%

Note: Your -2.06% suggests different period selection
```
**✅ Your Result: -2.06% (Period Decline)**
