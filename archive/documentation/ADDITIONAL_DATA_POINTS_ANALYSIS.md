### **What's Missing (High Impact):**

---

## 🎯 TIER 1: CRITICAL DATA (Highest Impact on Valuation)

### **1. Floor Number** 🏢
**Impact**: HIGH (±5-20%)
**Why It Matters:**
- Ground floor: -10% to -15% (noise, privacy, security concerns)
- Mid floors (5-15): Baseline (0%)
- High floors (15-30): +5% to +10% (better views, less noise)
- Top floors (30+): +10% to +20% (penthouse effect, prestige)

**Use Cases:**
- Penthouse premium valuation
- Ground floor discount adjustment
- Sweet spot pricing (floors 10-20)

**Implementation:**
```python
def get_floor_premium(floor_number, total_floors):
    if floor_number <= 2:
        return -12.5  # Ground floor discount
    elif floor_number >= total_floors - 2:
        return +15.0  # Top floor premium
    elif floor_number >= total_floors * 0.7:
        return +8.0   # High floor premium
    elif floor_number >= total_floors * 0.4:
        return +3.0   # Mid-high floor
    else:
        return 0.0    # Mid floor baseline
```

**Data Requirements:**
- `floor_number` (integer)
- `total_floors_in_building` (integer)
- Missing data handling: Use building average

---

### **2. View Type** 🌅
**Impact**: VERY HIGH (±5-25%)
**Why It Matters:**
- Burj Khalifa view: +20% to +25%
- Marina/water view: +15% to +20%
- Park/golf course view: +10% to +15%
- Partial water view: +8% to +10%
- City/skyline view: +5% to +8%
- Street/building view: 0% (baseline)
- Construction/wall view: -5% to -10%

**Categories to Track:**
1. **Landmark Views**: Burj Khalifa, Burj Al Arab, Palm Jumeirah
2. **Water Views**: Marina, Sea, Creek, Canal
3. **Green Views**: Golf course, Park, Garden
4. **Mixed Views**: Partial water, City + water
5. **Standard Views**: Street, Building, Courtyard
6. **Negative Views**: Construction, Wall, Industrial

**Implementation:**
```python
VIEW_PREMIUMS = {
    'burj_khalifa': 22.5,
    'burj_al_arab': 20.0,
    'palm_view': 18.0,
    'marina_view': 17.5,
    'full_sea_view': 20.0,
    'golf_course': 12.5,
    'park_view': 10.0,
    'partial_water': 9.0,
    'city_skyline': 6.0,
    'standard': 0.0,
    'construction': -7.5
}
```

**Data Requirements:**
- `primary_view` (enum: burj, water, park, city, standard, etc.)
- `secondary_view` (optional)
- `view_quality` (unobstructed, partial, obstructed)
- Can be inferred from: floor + building location + direction

- Modern (3-5 years): +2% to +5% (good condition)
- Average (5-10 years): 0% (baseline)
- Older (10-15 years): -5% to -8% (maintenance needed)
- Very old (15-20 years): -10% to -15% (renovation required)
- Ancient (20+ years): -15% to -25% (major renovation)

**Depreciation Curve:**
```
Value
100% ┤     ╭────────╮
 95% ┤    ╱          ╲
 90% ┤   ╱            ╲___
 85% ┤  ╱                  ╲___
 80% ┤ ╱                       ╲___

     └────────────────────────────────→ Age
     0   5   10   15   20   25   30 years
```

**Special Cases:**
- **Heritage buildings**: May appreciate with age
- **Recent renovation**: Reset age to 0-3 years
- **Developer quality**: Emaar holds value better than others

**Implementation:**
```python
def get_age_adjustment(age_years, building_quality='standard'):
    if age_years <= 1:
        return +12.5
    elif age_years <= 3:
        return +6.5
    elif age_years <= 5:
        return +3.0
    elif age_years <= 10:
        return 0.0
    elif age_years <= 15:
        return -6.5
    elif age_years <= 20:
        return -12.5
    else:
        return -20.0
```
