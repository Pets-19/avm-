## 🛠️ TECHNICAL CHANGES

### **1. Database (PostgreSQL)**
```sql
-- New table created
CREATE TABLE project_premiums (
    project_name TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    premium_percentage DECIMAL(5,2) NOT NULL,
    tier TEXT NOT NULL,
    avg_price_sqm DECIMAL(10,2),
    transaction_count INT,
    notes TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Index for fast lookups
CREATE INDEX idx_project_name_lower ON project_premiums(LOWER(project_name));

-- 10 premium projects inserted
```

### **2. Backend (app.py)**

**New Function Added (Line ~412):**
```python
def get_project_premium(project_name):
    """
    Get premium percentage for a specific project.
    Returns {'premium_percentage': 0-20, 'tier': 'Ultra-Luxury'|'Super-Premium'|'Premium'|None}
    """
    # Case-insensitive lookup in project_premiums table
    # Returns 0% if not found
    # Handles errors gracefully
```

**Modified Function (calculate_valuation_from_database):**
- Added project premium calculation after location premium
- Applies project premium to estimated value
- Calculates combined premium (location + project)
- Added to response JSON:
  - `project_premium.premium_pct`
  - `project_premium.tier`
  - `project_premium.project_name`
  - `project_premium.applied`
  - `combined_premium`

**Lines Changed**: ~60 lines added

### **3. Frontend (templates/index.html)**

**New HTML Card (Line ~598):**
```html
<div class="detail-card" id="project-premium-card">
    - Project Name display
    - Premium Percentage (+20%, +15%, +10%)
    - Tier Badge (color-coded)
    - Combined Premium (Location + Project)
</div>
```

**New JavaScript (Line ~2283):**
```javascript
// Display project premium card
if (valuation.project_premium && valuation.project_premium.applied) {
    // Show card
    // Display project name, premium %, tier badge
    // Calculate and display combined premium
    // Color-code tier badges
}
```

**Lines Changed**: ~50 lines added

## 🎓 LESSONS LEARNED

### **What Worked Well**
✅ Simple database design (no over-engineering)  
✅ Modular function (easy to test/debug)

### **What Could Be Improved**
⚠️ No fuzzy matching (requires exact project name)  
⚠️ Manual curation (not auto-calculated)  
⚠️ No admin UI (requires SQL to update)  
⚠️ No A/B testing framework  

### **Risks Mitigated**
✅ Database errors → Returns 0%, logs warning  
✅ Project not found → Returns 0%, continues valuation  
✅ Null project name → Handles gracefully  
✅ Database connection fails → Catches exception, returns 0%
