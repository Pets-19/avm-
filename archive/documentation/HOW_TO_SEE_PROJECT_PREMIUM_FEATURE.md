## 🐛 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Problem: Project Premium card doesn't show**

**Possible reasons:**
1. ❌ Wrong area selected (check table above for correct area)
2. ❌ No properties found in that area/size
3. ❌ Project name doesn't match database exactly

**Solution:**
- Try **Trump Tower** first (Business Bay, 115 sqm) - it has 205 properties
- Or try **ROVE HOME** (Dubai Marina, 120 sqm) - it has 617 properties

### **Problem: Page doesn't load**

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if Flask is running
ps aux | grep "python app.py"

# If not running, start it:
cd /workspaces/avm-retyn && python app.py
```

### **Problem: Can't find the area in dropdown**

**Solution:**
- Type to search in the dropdown
- Make sure spelling matches exactly (e.g., "Business Bay" not "business bay")
- Check the table above for exact area names
