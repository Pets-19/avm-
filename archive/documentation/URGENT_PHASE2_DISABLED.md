# üö® URGENT: Phase 2 Features Temporarily Disabled

## Issue Summary

**Error**: HTTP 500 when requesting valuations  
**Cause**: Phase 2 "Similar Projects" feature causing server hang/timeout  
**Status**: ‚úÖ TEMPORARILY FIXED - Site is working again  
**Date**: October 8, 2025 - 16:06

---

## What Happened

When implementing Phase 2 Quick Wins (comparison table, CSV export, trend badge), the `get_similar_projects()` function was integrated into the valuation API response. However, this caused the valuation endpoint to hang indefinitely, resulting in HTTP 500 errors.

**Error Flow**:
```
User requests valuation
‚Üì
API calls get_similar_projects()
‚Üì
Function hangs (possible infinite loop or deadlock)
‚Üì
Flask doesn't respond
‚Üì
Browser shows "HTTP 500: Internal Server Error"
```

---

## Temporary Fix Applied

**File**: `app.py` line ~1947

**Changed FROM** (causing hang):
```python
'similar_projects': get_similar_projects(
    project_name,
    project_tier,
    limit=10
) if project_premium_pct > 0 else []
```

**Changed TO** (working now):
```python
'similar_projects': []  # TEMPORARILY DISABLED - Phase 2 feature causing issues
```

---

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Working Features
- Property valuations (Al Wasl, City Walk, etc.)
- Phase 1: Project premium tooltip
- Phase 1: Modal with 3 sections (Breakdown, Validation, Impact)
- Phase 1: Location premium calculation
- Phase 1: Rental yield display
- Phase 2: CSV export route (backend ready, just no data to export yet)
- Phase 2: Trend badge HTML (ready, just no similar projects to compare)

### ‚ùå Temporarily Disabled
- Phase 2: Comparison table (Section 4 in modal) - empty array returned
- Phase 2: Similar projects backend query

### ‚ö†Ô∏è User-Reported Issues (Still Need Investigation)
1. **Rental yield not visible** - User says "i can't see rental yield feature"
   - Need to check if rental yield card is actually showing in browser
   - Previous fix added visibility/opacity styles, but may need verification

---

## Root Cause Analysis

**Possible Issues** with `get_similar_projects()`:

1. **Database Query Hang**:
   ```python
   query = text("""
       SELECT project_name, tier, premium_percentage, 
              COALESCE(transaction_count, 0) as txn_count
       FROM project_premiums
       WHERE tier = :tier 
         AND LOWER(project_name) != LOWER(:current_project)
       ORDER BY COALESCE(transaction_count, 0) DESC, premium_percentage DESC
       LIMIT :limit
   """)
   ```
   - Query might be slow or timing out
   - `project_premiums` table might have indexing issues
   - Database connection pool exhaustion

2. **Infinite Loop**:
   - Code review shows no obvious loops, but async/await issues possible
   - Engine connection might not be properly closed

3. **Exception Not Caught**:
   - Try/except block exists, but exception might not be triggering
   - Silent failure causing hang instead of error

---

## Next Steps to Fix Properly

### Step 1: Debug the Query
```bash
# Test query directly in psql
psql -d avm_retyn -c "
SELECT project_name, tier, premium_percentage, 
       COALESCE(transaction_count, 0) as txn_count
FROM project_premiums
WHERE tier = 'Premium' 
  AND LOWER(project_name) != LOWER('City Walk Crestlane 2')
ORDER BY COALESCE(transaction_count, 0) DESC, premium_percentage DESC
LIMIT 10;
"
```

### Step 2: Add Timeout Protection
```python
def get_similar_projects(project_name, tier, limit=10):
    if not engine or not project_name or not tier:
        logger.warning("get_similar_projects called with invalid params")
        return []
    
    try:
        # Add query timeout
        query = text("""
            SET statement_timeout = 5000;  -- 5 second timeout
            SELECT project_name, tier, premium_percentage, 
                   COALESCE(transaction_count, 0) as txn_count
            FROM project_premiums
            WHERE tier = :tier 
              AND LOWER(project_name) != LOWER(:current_project)
            ORDER BY COALESCE(transaction_count, 0) DESC, premium_percentage DESC
            LIMIT :limit
        """)
        
        with engine.connect() as conn:
            result = conn.execute(query, {
                'tier': tier,
                'current_project': project_name,
                'limit': limit
            })
            
            similar = []
            for row in result:
                similar.append({
                    'name': row[0],
                    'tier': row[1],
                    'premium': float(row[2]) if row[2] else 0.0,
                    'transactions': int(row[3]) if row[3] else 0
                })
            
            logger.info(f"‚úÖ Found {len(similar)} similar projects for {project_name}")
            return similar
            
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"‚ùå Error fetching similar projects: {str(e)}", exc_info=True)
        return []  # Always return empty list on error
```

### Step 3: Add Fallback Mock Data
```python
# If database query fails, use cached/mock data for demo
MOCK_SIMILAR_PROJECTS = {
    'City Walk Crestlane 2': [
        {'name': 'City Walk Crestlane 3', 'tier': 'Premium', 'premium': 10.0, 'transactions': 38}
    ]
}

def get_similar_projects_safe(project_name, tier, limit=10):
    """Wrapper with mock data fallback"""
    try:
        result = get_similar_projects(project_name, tier, limit)
        if result:
            return result
        # Fallback to mock data for known projects
        return MOCK_SIMILAR_PROJECTS.get(project_name, [])
    except:
        return []
```

### Step 4: Test Incrementally
1. Re-enable `get_similar_projects()` with timeout
2. Test with curl: `curl -X POST ... -d '...'` (5-10 second max wait)
3. Check Flask logs for query execution time
4. Monitor database connections: `SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity;`
5. If still hanging, add more logging to pinpoint exact line

## Rental Yield Visibility Issue

User reported: "i can't see rental yield feature, please check"

**Previous Fix** (Phase 1):
```javascript
// Line ~2540 in index.html
rentalYieldCard.style.display = 'block';
rentalYieldCard.style.visibility = 'visible';
rentalYieldCard.style.opacity = '1';
```

**Verification Needed**:
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Get valuation for City Walk Crestlane 2
3. Search for element with class `rental-yield-card`
4. Check computed styles:
   ```
   display: block ‚úÖ
   visibility: visible ‚úÖ
   opacity: 1 ‚úÖ
   height: auto (not 0) ‚úÖ
   ```
5. If still not visible, check parent containers for `display: none`

---

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Verify Valuation Works
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/valuation \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"property_type":"Unit (Apartment/Flat)","area":"Al Wasl","size":120,"bedrooms":"Any","status":"Any"}'
```

**Expected**: JSON response in < 30 seconds with valuation data

**Success Criteria**:
- Response received (not hanging)
- Status 200
- Contains `estimated_value`, `location_premium`, `project_premium`
- `similar_projects` is empty array `[]`

### Test 2: Verify Rental Yield Card
1. Open http://localhost:5000
2. Fill form: Al Wasl, 120 sqm, Any bedrooms
3. Click "Get Property Valuation"
4. Scroll down to "Rental Yield Potential" card
5. Verify card is visible with gold border and data

**Expected**: Card displays with yield percentage and annual rent

## Communication to User

**Status**: Site is working again! Valuations are processing normally.

**What's Available**:
- ‚úÖ All Phase 1 features working
- ‚úÖ Project premium tooltip & detailed modal
- ‚úÖ Location premium with 6 factors
- ‚úÖ Rental yield calculation

**What's Temporarily Disabled**:
- ‚è≥ Comparison table (Section 4) - will be empty
- ‚è≥ Similar projects feature - under investigation

**What We Need from You**:
1. Confirm valuation is working (try City Walk Crestlane 2, Al Wasl, 120sqm)
2. Check if you can NOW see the rental yield card (gold border, bottom right)
3. If rental yield still not visible, please take a screenshot showing what you see

## Timeline

- **16:06** - Identified hang issue with `get_similar_projects()`
- **16:06** - Applied temporary fix (disabled feature)
- **16:06** - Flask restarted successfully
- **Next** - Await user confirmation that valuation works
- **Next** - Debug rental yield visibility if still an issue
- **Next** - Fix `get_similar_projects()` with timeout protection
- **Next** - Re-enable Phase 2 features with proper error handling

---

## Files Modified

1. **app.py** (line ~1947):
   - Changed `get_similar_projects()` call to empty array `[]`
   - Function still exists (lines 540-590) but not being called

2. **templates/index.html**:
   - Phase 2 HTML/JavaScript remains (comparison table, CSV button, trend badge)
   - Will automatically work once `similar_projects` array is populated again

---

## Priority Actions

**IMMEDIATE** (User Waiting):
1. ‚úÖ Get valuation working - DONE
2. ‚è≥ Verify rental yield visibility with user
3. ‚è≥ Confirm no other broken features

**TODAY**:
1. Debug `get_similar_projects()` query timeout
2. Add proper error handling and logging
3. Re-enable feature with safeguards
4. Test Phase 2 features end-to-end

**THIS WEEK**:
1. Add database query monitoring
2. Optimize `project_premiums` table indexes
3. Implement connection pool limits
4. Add health check endpoint

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues persist:
```bash
# Option 1: Revert to before Phase 2
git stash
git checkout <commit-before-phase-2>
python app.py

# Option 2: Keep Phase 1, fully remove Phase 2 code
# Remove get_similar_projects() function (lines 540-590)
# Remove CSV export route (lines 1975-2025)
# Remove Phase 2 JavaScript (lines ~2457-2735 in index.html)
```

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always test with real data before deploying** - Mock data worked, real query hung
2. **Add timeouts to all database queries** - Prevent indefinite hangs
3. **Use feature flags** - Easy enable/disable without code changes
4. **Monitor query performance** - Log execution times for all queries
5. **Incremental rollout** - Test one feature at a time, not all 3 together

---

**Status**: üü° PARTIALLY WORKING (Phase 1 ‚úÖ | Phase 2 ‚ùå)  
**Next Action**: User testing + rental yield verification  
**ETA for Full Fix**: Same day once root cause identified
