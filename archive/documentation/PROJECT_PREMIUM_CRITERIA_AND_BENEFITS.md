## 📈 FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS (Roadmap)

### **Phase 2: Data-Driven Scoring (Month 2)**

Instead of manual curation, auto-calculate premiums based on:

#### **1. Price Performance (40% weight)**
```python
premium_score = (project_avg_price - area_avg_price) / area_avg_price * 100
# Trump Tower: (39,924 - 28,000) / 28,000 * 100 = +42.6%
# Premium: +42.6% * 40% = +17% (rounds to +15% tier)
```

#### **2. Transaction Volume (20% weight)**
```python
volume_score = min(transaction_count / 500, 1.0) * 20
# ROVE HOME: min(617 / 500, 1.0) * 20 = +20% (high demand)
```

#### **3. Developer Brand (20% weight)**
```python
developer_score = {
    'Emaar': 20,
    'Meraas': 18,
    'Nakheel': 18,
    'Damac': 15,
    'Azizi': 12,
    'Others': 0
}
```

#### **4. Amenity Score (10% weight)**
```python
amenity_score = sum([
    gym * 2,
    pool * 3,
    concierge * 5,
    beach_access * 8,
    hotel_services * 10
])
```

#### **5. Location Quality (10% weight)**
```python
location_score = (metro_proximity + beach_proximity + mall_proximity) / 3
```

**Final Premium Calculation:**
```python
total_premium = (
    price_performance * 0.40 +
    volume_score * 0.20 +
    developer_score * 0.20 +
    amenity_score * 0.10 +
    location_score * 0.10
)

# Tier Classification:
