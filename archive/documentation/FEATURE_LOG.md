## Detailed Feature Breakdown

### Feature #1: Market Segment Badge

**Date:** October 11-12, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Total Time:** 60 minutes

#### Time Breakdown
- Requirements & Analysis: 5 min ✅
- Implementation: 15 min ✅
- Testing: 10 min ⚠️
- Bug Discovery: 5 min ⚠️
- Bug Fix: 5 min ✅
- Documentation: 20 min ⚠️ (token heavy)
- Verification: 5 min ⚠️

#### What Worked Well
- Clear initial requirements
- Approval before implementation
- Immediate bug reporting with screenshots
- Test-driven approach (21 tests)
- Comprehensive documentation

#### What Slowed Us Down
- Token budget exhaustion (300+ line docs)
- Multiple Flask restarts (manual)
- Discovery of two display locations
- Database schema exploration
- Back-and-forth clarifications

#### Lessons Learned
1. **Create PROJECT_CONTEXT.md** to avoid exploration time
2. **Use deployment scripts** instead of manual restarts
3. **Minimal documentation** during implementation (full docs later)
4. **Test while implementing** not after
5. **Check all display locations** before claiming done

#### Improvements for Next Feature
- [ ] Use feature request template (save 3 min)
- [ ] Read PROJECT_CONTEXT.md first (save 5 min)
- [ ] Use `./test_runner.sh` script (save 2 min)
- [ ] Use `./deploy.sh` script (save 3 min)
- [ ] Inline docs only (save 15 min)
- **Expected Time:** 32 minutes (-47%)

## Bug Tracking

| Feature | Bug Description | Discovery Time | Fix Time | Total Cost | Prevention |
|---------|----------------|----------------|----------|------------|------------|
| Segment Badge | Badge only in KPI cards, not valuation details | 24 hours | 5 min | 30 min | Check all UI locations before deploy |

**Bug Rate:** 100% (1 bug / 1 feature)  
**Target:** <10%

---

## Performance Benchmarks

| Feature | Target Time | Actual Time | Impact |
|---------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| Segment Classification | <50ms | ~10ms | ✅ Negligible |

---

## Test Coverage Trends

| Week | Features | Avg Coverage | Tests Written | Tests Passed |
|------|----------|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| Oct 11-17 | 1 | 95.2% | 21 | 20 |

---

## Technology Decisions

| Feature | Decision | Rationale | Alternative Considered |
|---------|----------|-----------|------------------------|
| Segment Badge | Percentile-based classification | Fast, no ML needed, data-driven | ML clustering, manual rules |

---

## Documentation Generated

| Feature | Doc Files | Total Lines | Time Spent |
|---------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Segment Badge | 5 files | 400+ pages | 20 min |

**Note:** Too much documentation during implementation. Moving to inline comments only.

## Notes & Observations

### General
- Initial setup takes ~30 minutes but saves 40+ minutes per feature
- Template-driven requests are much clearer
- Testing while implementing catches bugs early
- Minimal documentation reduces token usage significantly

### AI Interaction Patterns
- Explicit rules prevent over-documentation
- "START IMMEDIATELY" reduces analysis paralysis
- Context files eliminate exploration time
- Time limits keep AI focused

### Technical Patterns
- Django-style test fixtures speed up testing
- Deployment scripts reduce human error
- Feature flags would enable safer deployments
- Database migrations need automation
