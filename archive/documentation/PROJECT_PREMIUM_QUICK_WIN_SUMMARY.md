## 💡 HOW IT WORKS

```
User submits valuation request
         ↓
App finds comparable properties
         ↓
Calculates base valuation (median price)
         ↓
Applies LOCATION premium (±20%)  ← Existing feature
         ↓
Applies PROJECT premium (+0-20%)  ← NEW FEATURE
         ↓
Combined premium = Location + Project (capped at -20% to +70%)
         ↓
Final Value = Base × (1 + Combined Premium)
         ↓
Display on UI with breakdown
```
