## üî¢ Key Formulas Used

### 1. Price Change Calculation
```
Price Change (%) = ((Latest Price - Earliest Price) / Earliest Price) √ó 100
Example: ((2,740,000 - 2,600,000) / 2,600,000) √ó 100 = +4.97%
```

### 2. Volatility Calculation (8.69%)
```
Step 1: Calculate percentage changes between periods
price_changes = [+1.92%, +1.89%, +1.85%, -0.36%]

Step 2: Calculate standard deviation
volatility = standard_deviation(price_changes) = 8.69%
```

### 3. Price Stability Components
```
Standard Deviation = ¬±AED 155,110 (average price swing)
Volatility % = (Standard Deviation / Mean Price) √ó 100 = 8.69%
```

### 4. Market Activity Calculation
```
Volume Change = ((19,766 - 3,400) / 3,400) √ó 100 = +481.24%
Monthly Growth Rate = Average monthly percentage change = +110.96%
```

### 5. Affordability Index
```
Affordability Index = (Current Price / Baseline) √ó 100
= (2,740,000 / 2,500,000) √ó 100 = 109.73%
Meaning: Properties are 9.73% less affordable than baseline
```
