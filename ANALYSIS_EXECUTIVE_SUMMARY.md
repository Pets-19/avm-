## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES

### 1. **Security: Passwords Not Hashed** (HIGH PRIORITY)
```python
# Current (INSECURE):
'password': 'retyn*#123'

# Should be:
'password_hash': generate_password_hash('retyn*#123')
```
**Impact:** Passwords visible in source code  
**Fix Time:** 1 hour  
**Must fix before launch:** YES ✅

### 2. **Hardcoded Users** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- Only 2 users in source code
- No user management system
- No role-based access control

**Impact:** Can't add new users without code changes  
**Fix Time:** 1-2 weeks (build user management)  
**Required for launch:** NO (can add post-launch)

### 3. **Large Monolithic File** (LOW PRIORITY)
- app.py is 3,937 lines
- Should be split into modules

**Impact:** Harder to maintain  
**Fix Time:** 2-3 days  
**Required for launch:** NO (refactor later)
