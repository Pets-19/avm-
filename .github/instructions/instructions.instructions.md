Provide project context and coding guidelines that AI should follow when generating code, answering questions, or reviewing changes.

- if venv is present, use it
- use black formatting
- use type hints
- use logging instead of print
- write modular code with functions and classes
- write unit tests for new functionality
- prefer list/dict comprehensions
- prefer built-in functions and libraries
- prefer f-strings for formatting
- prefer pathlib for file paths
- do without affecting the rest functionality unless asked
- follow PEP 8 style guide
- follow existing project structure and conventions
- follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- follow SOLID principles
- follow YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) principle
- write clear and concise docstrings
- write meaningful commit messages
- avoid hardcoding values, use constants or config files
- avoid deep nesting, refactor into smaller functions or use guard clauses
- avoid global variables, use function parameters or class attributes
- avoid premature optimization, focus on readability and maintainability first
- avoid using wildcard imports
- avoid using mutable default arguments
- avoid using bare except clauses
- avoid using print statements for debugging, use logging instead
- avoid using magic numbers, use named constants instead
- avoid using too many function parameters, consider using data classes or dictionaries
- avoid using too many nested loops, consider using itertools or helper functions
- avoid using too many return statements in a function, consider refactoring into smaller functions
- avoid using too many comments, write self-explanatory code instead
- avoid using too many blank lines, follow PEP 8 guidelines
- avoid using too many inline comments, write self-explanatory code instead
- avoid using too many global imports, import only what is necessary
- avoid using too many nested functions, consider using helper functions or classes
