## Quick Reference

### Common Commands
```bash
# Run tests
./test_runner.sh

# Deploy
./deploy.sh

# Check logs
tail -f flask.log

# Check server
ps aux | grep app.py
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

### Common Issues
- **Badge not visible:** Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- **Tests failing:** Check database connection
- **Server not starting:** Check flask.log for errors
- **Slow queries:** Add database indexes
