## 🚀 Quick Start for Testing

### Access the Application
```
URL: http://localhost:5000
User: dhanesh@retyn.ai
Pass: retyn*#123
```

### Test Sequence (5 minutes)
1. **Navigate:** Property Valuation tab
2. **Find:** "📈 Flip Score (Investment)" dropdown (after ESG filter)
3. **Test Basic:** Select "70+" → Enter Area: "Madinat Al Mataar" → Size: 2000 → Get Valuation
4. **Check Console:** F12 → Console → Look for `flip_score_min: 70`
5. **Check Logs:** Terminal running Flask → Look for `📈 [DB] Filtering for Flip score >= 70`

### Expected Results
- ✅ Dropdown visible with 5 options
- ✅ Filter works (reduces comparables)
- ✅ Combined ESG + Flip works
- ✅ No errors in console or logs

**Quick Reference:** `/workspaces/avm-/archive/documentation/FLIP_SCORE_FILTER_QUICK_REFERENCE.md`

### Technical Support
```bash
# Check Flask logs
tail -f /workspaces/avm-/flask.log | grep -i flip

# Verify database
cd /workspaces/avm-
python -c "from app import engine; from sqlalchemy import text; \
conn = engine.connect(); \
result = conn.execute(text('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM properties WHERE flip_score IS NOT NULL')); \
print(f'Flip score properties: {result.fetchone()[0]}')"

### Common Issues & Solutions
| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Dropdown not visible | Check templates/index.html line ~598, verify Flask restarted |
| Filter not working | Check console for `flip_score_min`, check Flask logs for debug message |
| No results | Try lower threshold or different area |
| Performance slow | Check database index exists: `idx_flip_score` |
